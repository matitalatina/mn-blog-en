Here we are, with a new shiny blog!

I decided to make another personal blog. But this is different from [my previous one](https://www.mattianatali.it).

## It's in English.

I used to write in Italian since I'm Italian! But I realized that the preferred language is English for technical posts.

It isn't an easy switch for me, because I love Italy and I wanted to spread some knowledge in my native tongue. But writing posts in Italian, I reach a niche of a niche... I don't know if it's so useful.

Another big reason is that all the references that I link in my blog posts were in English! So even an Italian reader should know English to understand the content properly.

## It's about my job

My previous blog was more personal, it started with no fixed idea on what I would write in it. In fact, it was more an exercise on how to deploy a [Ghost blog](https://ghost.org/) and how to build a [Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The content inside it is more mixed: from photography, games and tech posts.

In this blog, I want to share with you my thoughts on my daily job, how I tackled some challenging task, or simply what I'm doing at work.

I want to share some content that is useful for other developers.

I hope that I'll have some time to share this stuff and I hope you like them!
